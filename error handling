require()
-check for valid conditions
-check input arguments (malicious actors can send bad inputs)
-revert error if conditions are not true and stops the function execution; all the operations happend before will be reverted. And any leftover gas will be refunded.

assert()
-check for internal errors i.e. only throw error only when there is an error in the CODE.
-check invariants
    -Invariants --> conceptual condition that is supposed to be always true at a particular point in the code.
    E.g: withdrawAll function after execution should result in balance becoming zero. Assert can check/validate this concept(invariant).
