when a storage variable is assigned memory variable or vice versa, then the assignment would be COPY
when a memory variable is assigned another memory variable the the assignment would be through reference(pointer)
when a storage variable is assigned storage variable, then the assignment would be through referencer(pointer)

pragma solidity 0.8.1

contract ABC {

uint[] storageArray;

function test(uint[] memory memoryArray1) {

storageArray = memoryArray1; // E.g let memoryArray1 = [1,2,3], then storageArray would be [1,2,3]
memoryArray1.push(4); // storageArray would STILL be [1,2,3] only bcoz it is assigning by COPY
uint[] storage storageArray2 = storageArray;
storageArray2.push(5); // then storageArray also would be changed to [1,2,3,5] bcoz it is assigning by pointer.
